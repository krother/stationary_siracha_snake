"""
Tests for the Playground class:

- creating a Playground object works
- after creating a Playground object it has the correct size attribute
- food should be inside the Playground size
- add_random_food puts the food in random positions
- food is not placed on obstacles (boundaries)
- is_obstacle for a coordinate inside gives True
- is_obstacle for a coordinate at the boundary gives False
